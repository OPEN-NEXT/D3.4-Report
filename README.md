## Original task description

Task 3.4: Data collection\
Lead Partner: [WMDE](https://www.ipk.fraunhofer.de/)\
Participants: [FHG](https://www.ipk.fraunhofer.de/), [WIF](https://wikifactory.com/)

Three channels are being used for populating the Wikidata instance:

- Wikifactory. Together with WIF, WMDE will develop an interface to transfer data from Wikifactory
to the Wikibase instance. Thanks to this interface, Wikidata will deliver a data structuration and query
view on the data stored in Wikifactory, which delivers a data presentation and edition view.
- Web crawler. WMDE will crawl OSH-related data from other libraries of OSH, such as the
Observatory of Open Source Hardware, the OSHWA Certification directory, GitHub and other Git-
based hardware repositories. This will ensure that the Wikibase instance covers a large part of the OSH
already published online.
- Hackathon or workshops will be conducted to generate and collect new data and user experience with
SMEs, fab labs and other OSH participants.

## Who is doing this?

[OPEN_NEXT](https://opennext.eu/) is a collaboration
between 19 industry and academic partners
across Europe.
Funded by the [European Union](https://europa.eu/)'s
[Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/) programme,
this project seeks to enable small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to work with consumers, makers, and other communities in rethinking how products are designed and produced.
[Open source hardware](https://www.oshwa.org/definition/) is a key enabler of this goal where the design of a physical product is released with the freedoms
for anyone to study, modify, share, and redistribute copies.
These essential freedoms are based on those of [open source software](https://opensource.org/osd),
which is itself derived from [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)
where the word free refers to freedom, *not* free-of-charge.
When put in practice, these freedoms could potentially not only reduce proprietary vendor lock-in, planned obsolescence, or waste but also stimulate novel – even disruptive – business models.
The SME partners in OPENNEXT are experimenting with producing open source hardware and even opening up the development process to wider community participation.
They produce diverse products ranging from [desks](https://stykka.com/),
[cargo bike modules](http://www.xyzcargo.com/), to a [digital scientific instrument platform](https://pslab.io/) (and [more](https://opennext.eu/project-team/#sme)).

The work carried out in this repository is subject to WP3 of OPEN!NEXT ("Supporting production engineering with ICT infrastructure") and lead by the [department of Information and Process Control at the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Systems and Design Technology](https://www.ipk.fraunhofer.de/en/about-us/organization/virtual-product-creation.html).
